# Vimrc

**vimrc** contains my personal vim configuration. It supports

* Go
* HTML
* CSS
* JSON
* JavaScript
* Markdown
* Makefile

![File](http://bit.ly/1mK8OGv)
![Directory](http://bit.ly/1mK8mZ1)

Furthermore it brings you some nice themes and is powered by
[vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.vim).

It will replace the old config which was too large and had problems with
indention.

## Install

You need to clone the repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/bodokaiser/vimrc

and then call `make` to copy all files to `~/.vimrc`

    $ cd vimrc && make
